# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


To run the project type this command in the terminal: npm run dev
In this project i have used bootstrap , react-rotuter-dom, font-awsome(for icons).

A slider was added in the home page and three animation
Thr first animation was used in the service part where when you hover there will bw a 360 degree rotation .
The second one in the contact part where you will see a car moving from left to right side .
the third one in reviews part where when you hover in the the part where your review is given ex.(5 star) a little star will pop in the left corner .
